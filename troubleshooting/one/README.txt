Steps through solving the example in the following sequence:
- Remove the "if" to prove the loop works
- add "i = i + 1"
- try adding back the "if"
- Remove the loop construct, test the if condition with 12 and 13
- Simplify to only trying to check / 3
- go to %
- go to % == 0
- go back to "puts #{i} if i % 3 == 0"
- Add % 4
- add the loop
